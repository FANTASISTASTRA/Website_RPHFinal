		<br> On 16 March 1521, the expedition proceeded to a place called Yunagan and Suluan, the latter an island under the jurisdiction of Guiuan, Eastern Samar.
		Because it was the feast day of San Lazaro, Magellan named the islands they sighted as Archipelago de San Lazaro.
		The sighting of Samar was later popularized as the “discovery of the Philippines,” which, for decades, has been a subject of debate.
		On the same day of sighting Samar, the expedition first anchored in a rocky place called Yunagan located near Suluan, according to Albo.
		Historian Danilo Gerona identified the place name as the present-day name of Guiuan.

		<br> The first Catholic mass in the Philippines was held on the small island of Limasawa. For a long time, there was controversy over whether it was held in Limasawa
		or Butuan. The leading opinion, based on translated contemporary sources and geographical analysis, seem to support Limasawa much more as the site of the country's
		first mass.

		<br>On 27 April 1521, forces under the command of Lapulapu defeated a Spanish raid led by the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan on the shores of Mactan Island. 
		The battle erupted from a leadership dispute between Lapulapu and Rajah Humabon of neighboring Sugbo (present day Cebu) wherein Magellan offered to attack Mactan on
		behalf of Humabon as a demonstration of European fighting prowess and as a sign of their friendship. Magellan and his fleet found themselves in Cebu during
		their expedition in search of the Spice Islands of the Mollucas.
		After their defeat at the hands of the warriors of Mactan, the surviving Spanish were later chased out of Cebu by Humabon and went on to other
		parts of the present day Philippines and Southeast Asia. Sebastian Elcano, captain of the ship Victoria, and his crew continued their journey back to Spain
		via a route through the Indian Ocean and completed the earliest recorded circumnavigation of the World.
