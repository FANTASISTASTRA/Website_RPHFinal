		<br>The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines was ratified on February 2, 1987, following the EDSA People Power Revolution that ousted Ferdinand Marcos from power. It replaced the 1973 Constitution, which was associated with Marcos' authoritarian rule during Martial Law. The new Constitution was drafted by a Constitutional Commission appointed by President Corazon Aquino with the goal of restoring democracy, protecting human rights, and preventing the return of dictatorship.
