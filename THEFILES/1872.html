		<td class="inside"><strong>February 17, 1872</strong><br>
		<br> On February 17, 1872, Fathers Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos, and Jocinto Zamora, collectively known as Gomburza, were executed by Spanish
    colonial authorities on charges of subversion. These charges stemmed from their purported involvement in the workers' uprising at the Cavite 
    Naval Yard. The execution of Gomburza incited profound anger and resentment among the Filipino populace, leading them to challenge the Spanish 
    authorities and advocate for reforms. The martyrdom of these three priests significantly contributed to the emergence of the Propaganda Movement,
    which sought to address grievances and raise awareness in Spain regarding the abuses perpetrated by its colonial administration. 
            <br><br>
    The illustrados emerged as the leaders in the pursuit of reforms, bolstered by their education and newfound wealth, which instilled in them a 
    greater confidence to articulate the concerns of the populace. However, as the illustrados were products of the gradual changes introduced by 
    the Spanish government, they faced limitations in their ability to advocate forcefully for the reforms they desired. Although the illustrados 
    were unable to alleviate the hardships faced by Filipinos, their efforts gave rise to another group known as the intelligentsia. This faction also
    sought reforms but adopted a more systematic approach, employing peaceful methods through the Propaganda Movement.
