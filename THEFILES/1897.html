		<br>Thirteen Filipino patriots were executed by musketry at Bagumbayan Field
        (now Rizal Park) in Manila. These men, known as the Thirteen Martyrs of Bagumbayan, were members of the Katipunan,
        a revolutionary society founded by Andr√©s Bonifacio. Their execution marked a significant moment in the Philippine Revolution against
        Spanish colonial rule.

		<br> The Tejeros Convention, held on March 22, 1897, was a crucial gathering of revolutionary leaders to discuss the future of the
        Philippine Revolution. During this convention, Emilio Aguinaldo was elected as the first president of the revolutionary government, and
        Bonifacio was appointed as Director of the Interior. However, tensions arose between the ilustrados (educated class) and the plebeians 
        (commoners), leading to disputes over leadership and the direction of the revolution.

		<td class="inside"><strong>May 10, 1897</strong><br>
		<br>Following the Tejeros Convention, Bonifacio and his followers felt betrayed and marginalized. They initiated a counterrevolutionary
        movement, leading to a conflict with Aguinaldo's forces. Bonifacio and his brother Procopio were captured and tried by a court-martial.
        They were found guilty of sedition and treason and were subsequently executed on May 10, 1897.

		<td class="inside"><strong>December 14, 1897</strong><br>
		<br>To temporarily halt hostilities between the Filipinos and the Spanish, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed on December 14, 1897.
        This agreement allowed Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries to exile themselves to Hong Kong in exchange for a substantial sum of money
        from the Spanish government. While the pact provided a brief respite, it ultimately proved to be a temporary solution as the Philippine
        Revolution would continue upon Aguinaldo's return to the Philippines.
